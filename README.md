# Finite volume schemes: an introduction

This repository contains:
  - `README.pdf`: An instruction document for a tutorial in which you are guided
    through the development of a 1D finite volume solver in Python.
  - `finite_volume_schemes_part1/2.pdf`: The slides for two guest lectures about
    finite volume schemes that serve as an introduction to the tutorial.
  - `riemannsolver.py`: A standalone exact Riemann solver that can be used as an
    external library for the tutorial.
  - `sodshock_solution.py`: A Python script that returns a reference solution
    for the 1D Sod shock problem. This script can also be used as an external
    library for the tutorial.
  - `LICENSE`: The free software license that allows redistribution of the
    Python scripts mentioned above.
  - `README.md`: This file.
